# Dev

Dev is the idea of turning this entire repo into a developer portal

## Overview

Dev would be an all encompassing experience for developers. Primarily your focus as a developer 
is to build a product, project or service and doing that through the means of writing code. 
Dev or micro.dev would be a place where you could do this. The ability to write the code, to 
learn, to get hints as you're building and to leverage existing services.

We currently serve it at [dev.m3o.com](https://dev.m3o.com).
