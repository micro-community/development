# Release Process

As we mature as an organisation we need to refine the release process to ensure that we can maintain a high velocity while also keeping code quality and stability high. This applies to both the OSS go-micro as much as any work on m3o or any other product.

The overarching approach should be to ensure that all changes undergo some form of extended testing period. Remember, the blast radius of errors in our code goes far beyond our own organisation so care must be taken.

## Background
We attempted using a [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model of branching with a `develop` and `master` branch for both `micro` and `go-micro`. However, Github does not support this model very well due to the way it tracks commits and diffs. See https://github.community/t/github-pull-requests-showing-invalid-diff-for-already-merged-branch/559. TLDR if you try to maintain two parallel branches you'll quickly end up in a position where diffs show, incorrectly, that there are missing commits. e.g. after a couple of releases if you do a compare between `develop` and `master` github will show you that there are differences between the two where in fact there isn't. Another downside of this approach was when accepting PRs from the community, outside contributors don't know to branch and PR against `develop`, rather, they do it against `master` and things very quickly get messy. 

The above points to the fact that it is easiest to maintain a single branch, `master`, and create feature branches off that i.e. using the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). This is what projects like kubernetes and terraform do so we're in good company. 

## go-micro

`go-micro` is generally consumed by users using the go module system which means that users will be pinned to named releases rather than `master` branch. While it is possible that there are some folks who just `go get/install` without modules or anything else who will get `master` branch it is already well documented that building Go programs without any sort of vendoring is a bad ideaâ„¢. We always code review anything that goes in to `master` and it should always pass tests etc in CI but we won't run the full battery of integration tests etc that we might otherwise for a full release. Therefore the stability of `master` is much less strict that it is for official releases.

We generally aim to cut new releases of the `go-micro` project frequently; approx every 2 weeks. 

### Process
We will have 1 long lived branch; 
- `master` - reflects the latest and greatest development. All code is reviewed before being merged in to this branch

All feature branches will be branched from and merged back to `master` via the usual PR process. 

New release candidates will be cut from the `master` branch roughly every 2 weeks. New minor releases are cut from the `master` branch as `release-X.X`. From this point, only bug fixes should be added to the release branch. 

If all clear after 7 days we will promote the release candidate to full version and cut a new release which means
1. tagging the `release-X.X` branch with the new release version `vX.X.X`
2. merging the release branch to `master`
3. the `release-X.X` branch is *not* deleted. It will be retained for any future patch fixes that may be required.

> :warning: remember to update the version in cmd/version.go

#### Patching
Bug fixes should be made on the `release-X.X` branch, tagged, and then merged back to `master`

### Testing
Before a release is given the all clear we must run a full suite of tests. Testing will include being built and run against:
- the current latest versioned release of `micro` 
- all of the example projects in https://github.com/micro/examples

We will also encourage users to start using releaase candidates in their testing CI and testing environments and ask them to report back with any issues. 


## micro

The `micro` project can be consumed as both tagged releases *and* directly from `master`. Similar to `go-micro` while we code review and test everything that goes in to `master` we are less thorough than for official releases. So it should follow the same branching and release process as defined for `go-micro` above. 

### Testing
Testing will include 
- running all integration tests in CI 
- running in non prod environment of m3o to shake out any bugs that require longer running

### Versioning
We follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) approach to release names. 

Just before we cut a new major release (v3, v4, etc) we should also create a branch of master to be maintained as the ongoing branch for the current release. This will allow us to provide bugfix support more easily for the release while the master branch moves on to the next major release. For example, before we start work on `v3` we should create a new branch from `master` as `v2`

## Automation
We have a few helper scripts to help with the release process. They can be found in the [scripts folder](./scripts)
