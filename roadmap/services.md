# Services

Micro Services are services offered on the M3O platform

## Overview

M3O is a cloud native platform for Micro services development. It is host to services offered by Micro to the world. 
Services are Go Micro based services serving a specific domain boundary via an RPC interface. Services provide 
some value but also act as building blocks for other services to be built on.

Services can extend beyond RPC to also provide an API, Web or Mobile apps.
