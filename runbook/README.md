# Runbook

This directory serves as the runbook for the platform and related services. 

## Overview

Runbooks are a way to manage systems in a deterministic way. They offer repeatable commands and known error cases and playbooks for how to operate. 
We maintain one flat runbook for the [Platform](platform.md). Other runbooks may appear over time for different purposes.
