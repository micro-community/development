# Product

All product and planning related docs for the Micro team can be found here. 

## Overview

- the [specs](specs) folder contains the detailed specifications for features. 
- the [roadmap](https://github.com/m3o/development/projects/11) project details the current roadmap. We aim to have the next 3 months planned to a reasonable level of detail including prioritisation and some high level ideas of how to implement and expected timelines. Everything beyond that is very rough and subject to a lot of change.

## Process
Before a feature can be worked on we will:
1. Create a design doc in [specs](specs) as a PR and share with the team for discussion.
2. Once agreed upon, the doc is approved and merged
3. Github issues covering the work required are created and added to the [project board](https://github.com/m3o/development/projects/10).
