## Account Recovery

Issue `micro signup --recover --email=youremail` which will email you instructions on how to log in to namespaces you have access to.
Currently there is no password recovery functionality, please contact us on Slack to do that.

## Changing Your Password

Use the following command to change password (you must already be logged in):

```
micro user set password
```

## Additional Users

You can add upto 5 additional users on the dev tier. Every additional user added to your account is billed at $35/month. Whether you invite 
them or just plain create the account we'll keep track and invoice this as "M3O Additonal Users" on your invoices. See 
[Get Started > Invite Users](/getting-started/invite-users) to see how to invite them.

## Additional Services

Beyond 10 services, we bill every additional service at $3/month. Additional service meaning anything with a new unique name
e.g users, customers, orders. We'll add a line item on your invoice called "M3O Additional Services" automatically.

## Cancellation

If you'd like to cancel your subscription please email [support@m3o.com](mailto:support@m3o.com).

## Fair Usage Policy

Our fair usage policy applies caps to usage on a per service and per namespace basis. This is so we can maintain a shared system 
for everyone to use in coordination and have a great experience. The limits are below but may change, vary or include new resource types.

Per service limits

- CPU - 1 core
- Memory - 128 mb
- Disk - 512 mb
