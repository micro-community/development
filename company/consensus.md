# Consensus and decision making

How to make decisions, collaborate and operate in the world of Micro and a distributed team.

## Overview

Micro operates as a distributed company which means a lot of the face to face, high bandwidth discussions and 
ad-hoc overhead conversations are lost. It also means decisions are made a bit differently. As we grow we want 
to faciliate a set of rules or guidelines that help us scale.

### Guidelines

A few guidelines for how to operate

### 1. Start a conversation

In a remote first environment its easy to avoid talking to people and sometimes it means we lose out 
on ways of clarifying our thinking, getting a second opinion or making mistakes that could be avoided 
upfront. When working on something, thinking about ideas, etc start a conversation. Get a dialogue 
going with other team members to help solve your problem, streamline your ideas, etc. It doesn't take 
much time but also helps others understand the context before you start working on something.

### 2. Write a design doc

If you're doing something new, adding a feature, creating a service, making a significant change or 
proposing something, the best thing to do is write one page that describes the problem, the solution 
you're advocating for and a design e.g interface and proto along with example usage. Again it 
clarifies your own thinking but also means we have strong documentation and a plan for anything 
being implemented.

### 3. Implement and get feedback

Once doc goes around and there's consensus or approval for implementation, get something written and 
start getting feedback. The faster you get feedback on the smallest working solution the more clarity 
you'll have as to whether you've gone down the right path or not. The rest of the team can help 
where minor things need to change or maybe the implementation highlights issues with design that 
need to be revisited. Less is more in this case.
